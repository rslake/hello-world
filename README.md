# hello-world
Information on this Git and among other things...

As of today, October 29, 2016, I am working on a B.S. in Information Technology with a Specialization in Computer Science. I am currently a senior at Marymount University in search of a internship, hopefully as an Android developer. My dream career track will take me into developing mobile apps and software that aid individuals to better help and serve one another. I thoroughly enjoy working on and solving new problems, especially ones that seem to be insolvable. Apart from that I enjoy spending time with my family and friends working together and playing table top games.
